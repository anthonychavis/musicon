## Introduction

The goal of this project was to update the website of an online store, Musicon, using a client-side templating engine known as Handlebars. Content is rendered on the webpage using arrays, objects, and control flow alongside Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.

I have not played much with the appearance of this project yet. I want to push through projects to play more with APIs, including creating projects myself.

## Technologies

-   JavaScript6
-   CSS3
-   HTML5
